Every day is totally different. He fixed layout bugs and optimized the code base of a hugely popular sport app in America in a short time. He has been mentoring for a lot of starter and junior developers for 3 years. It’s hectic and challenging, but he loves it! He is always eager to learn new technologies and develop solutions based on them.
