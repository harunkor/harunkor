# Hi 👋, I'm Harun.

📆 Experienced in Android since 2014\
🖥️ Aspired by learning something new

Harun is currently a Senior Android Developer at LVS R&D , where he does all process of Android Development.
Every day is totally different. He fixed layout bugs and optimized the code base of a hugely popular sport app in America in a short time. He has been mentoring for a lot of starter and junior developers for 3 years. It’s hectic and challenging, but he loves it! He is always eager to learn new technologies and develop solutions based on them. When he is not coding, you will find him traveling the world, biking, swimming, watching films, fishing, hiking and shopping.

I can steadily continue my projects and contribute to the open-source community. I try to give mentorship developers and my  colleagues    about workflow to   make their works easily, and I also give this mentorship to the Jr. developers.
